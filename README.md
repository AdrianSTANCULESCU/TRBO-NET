Here is new version ARS service and APRS gateway for TRBO. Old version had not
one file which was needed to run.

http://www.mediafire.com/file/rm2wv65dfhznh49/TRBO-NET-1.2.tar.gz

Extract with "tar xvfz TRBO-NET-1.2.tar.gz", cd TRBO-NET-1.2 and read README
file.

This was written with wireshark and other network monitoring, so all may not
work.
